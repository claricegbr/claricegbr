Hi, Iâ€™m @claricegbr ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m interested in many fields of knowledge, such as tecnology, sports, arts, health and everything that makes us improve our lives and the lives of people around us.

Currently learning about Git and Github, Games with Godot and UX / UI, here at DIO.
Trying to collaborate here, and looking forward to get more used to it.

About private life, I'm a capoeira instructor, with over 30 years of experience. Graduated in Tourism. From PetrÃ³polis RJ. 49 years old ðŸ‘€
